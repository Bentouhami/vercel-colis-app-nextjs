# Project TODOs

This document outlines future enhancements and areas for improvement in the ColisApp project.

## 1. Testing

- **Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests for all critical components, especially API routes, backend services, and utility functions, to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.

## 2. Error Handling & Logging

- **Centralized Error Handling**: Implement a standardized and centralized error handling mechanism across all application layers (API, services, UI) to ensure consistent error responses and graceful degradation.
- **Robust Logging System**: Integrate a comprehensive logging solution to capture application events, errors, and performance metrics for better monitoring and debugging.

## 3. Performance Optimization

- **Database Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize database queries to improve response times and reduce load on the database.
- **Caching Strategies**: Explore and implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache) to reduce database hits and improve performance.
- **Asset Optimization**: Optimize static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) for faster loading times.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated CI/CD**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.

## 5. Build & Deployment

- **Fix Build Errors**: Address and resolve any recurring build errors to ensure a stable and consistent build process.
